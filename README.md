### How to run:

Download raw of FlipperZero Payload.txt

Place discord webhook url into the line that says "PUT WEBHOOK HERE".

**DO NOT** remove the quotation marks.

Move to FlipperZero and run :D

(I may add more customization later like only sending specific webhooks and removing the embed spoilers.)

What will be sent:

If errors occour in the powershell terminal, it may be due to a slow computer messing up the timing of the DELAY functions in the payload. Remember, you can always enter these powershell lines manually and change the DELAY timings.
